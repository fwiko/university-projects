						<p>TryHackMe is an Online platform that allow users to learn cyber-security through challenges that are often based on real-world scenarios. There are a wide range of difficulties with challenges getting harder as you progress. There are learning paths set out to allow the user to follow a set path to feel a sense of direction including an offensive security path and defensive security path.<br><br>
							Each has a slight different approach to teaching however have the same goal which is to teach cyber-security.

				<h2>What was involved?</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Throughout my time using both tryhackme and hackthebox i covered many topics in both the cyber-security and more generalised computing fields. I beleive the activities that were offered and the ones that i completed gave me a good insight into what was involved in the cyber-security scene in addition to giving me valueable experience using different tools and techniques. <br><br> Below is a summary of some topics that were covered.</p>
				<div class="grid c2">
					<!-- Linux Systems Container
						Information about the usage of linux systems in this activity in a formatted structure-->
					<div class="container">
						<div class="container-header">
							<h2 style="display: inline;">Operating linux systems</h2>

						<div class="container-body">
							<ul>
								<li>File system management</li>
								<li>utilising command line tools</li>
								<li>virtual machines</li>
							</ul>
							<p>When completing tasks on both tryhackme and hackthebox, being able to access and utilize a linux system was a must. This allowed me to have the best experience as most tools used in each tasks were built with and for linux operating systems. To achieve this i used the virtualisation software "vmware workstation" to virtualise a kali linux destop system on my windows machine.</p>

								<li>john the ripper</li>
								<li>metasploit</li>
								<li>wireshark</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Throught my time using TryHackMe i completed many CTF (Capture the Flag) challenges requiring me to use the knowledge that i had gained to gain access to a external machine/network using a variety of techniques and security tools. </p>

				<p>I beleive that completing a variety of tasks using tryhackme has given me some incredibly valueable experience that will help me in the future, especially when completing this degree course. The tasks i have completed are directly related to this degree course i am studying and i hope i can put what i have learnt to good use. <br><br>I gained a vast number of experience on tryhackme over the many hours i spent doing tasks and challenges. Eventually reaching level 9, which i beleive is a mid-tier level on this particular site.</p>
