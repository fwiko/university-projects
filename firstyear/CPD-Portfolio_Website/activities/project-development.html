				<hr>
				<!-- Introduction paragraph -->
				<p>On the rare occasion that i come up with an idea of a project that i would like to pursue,  i like to try and build something that fits my requirements whilst also trying to follow the best programming standards when building the application. <br>
					The majority of my personal projects are written in either python, java, or javascript as those are the languages that i have used most often. My preference when building a project is to use oop (object oriented programming) where possible, because, i think it allows me to keep things much more organised and meet the "dry" (don't repeat yourself) principle easier.<br><br>Below are some summaries of the projects that i have recently worked on.

					<!-- Social Scanner Container -->
					<div class="container">
						<div class="container-header">
							<h2 style="display: inline;">Online social scanner</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="container-body">
							<p>Online social scanner is a web application that i developed that allows users to check the availability of a specified username on a variety of online social media platforms, games, or forums in the click of a button.<br><br>this application was written using javascript (Node.js) for the back-end web server and html, css, and javascript for the front-end.The back end uses web requests to check the availablity of usernames using a mix of apis (where available) or a simple page request.</p>

					<!-- Font Server Container -->
					<div class="container">
						<div class="container-header">
							<h2 style="display: inline;">Font Serving API</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="container-body">
							<p>When completing one of the first homework tasks for the web-development section of the essential skills section, i wanted to use a font that fit the theme of a newspaper headline. However the font i found was not available on services such as google fonts which meant i would have to include the font file in the homework submission. <br><br>This application allows me to import fonts into webpages via a simple url. And similar to the social scanner this also uses Node.js for the backend.</p>

					<!-- Keylogger Container -->
					<div class="container">
						<div class="container-header">
							<h2 style="display: inline;">Bind keylogger</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="container-body">
							<p>When looking for cyber-security related projects, i decided to create a simple keylogger application but with some improvements. <br><br>I implemented sockets into my program which allows me to run a server that will accept connections from various possible clients. The client script will listen for keystrokes and send anything that is typed onto the keyboard over to the server. The data can then be viewed using the command line and saved to a file. <br><br>This program was written in python 3.9 and i plan to convert it to python 3.10 sometime in the future.</p>

				<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Although i think that i already had a good understanding of programming concepts prior to starting this degree course. I think that working on these personal projects over the past couple of weeks/months has helped to reinforce my knowledge and ensure that i try to follow the best possible practices. <br><br>I think that this will help when it comes to completing both my web development assignment and programming exams for this term.</p>
